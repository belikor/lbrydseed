"""Mixin classes that add additional pages to the main graphical interface.

These classes should not be instantiatied directly. They are just used
in a multiple inheritance, or mixin pattern, to provide the necessary
building command to build the specific page in the main interface.

::
    class OtherPage:
        def setup_page_other(self, parent):
            ...

    class Application(ttk.Frame, OtherPage):
        def __init__(self, root):
            page_other = ttk.Frame(root)
            self.setup_page_other(page_other)

Currently empty but if there are classes that don't fit anywhere else
they could be placed here.
